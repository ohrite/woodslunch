For Orientation on 2013-08-19
-----------------------------

### Must have

- [ ] Make sure signup flow is okay.

- [ ] Bump all curent grades by 1.

- [ ] Add note to the effect of "Please check your account information for
  accuracy. Student names and grades are listed correctly." Add this to the
  dashboard page.

- [ ] Menu changes

- [ ] Able to order lunches. Open them up for the first month at least, starting
  with the first school day after Labor Day.

### Nice-to-have

- [ ] JavaScript to ensure that when changing the form and browsing away from
  the page before clicking submit, present a confirmation dialog.

- [ ] Donations. I'm thinking... a field that allows each account to choose an
  amount to enter to donate on a monthly basis. The number must be a whole
  number. It must be displayed as part of the balance owed.

- [ ] Report columns get cut off. Particularly, Wednesday and Friday Salad
  column. But check all of them.

- [ ] The summary on reports should display in the same order as rest of
  information.

- [ ] Always display arrows on month view for admins.

- [ ] Send an email with the same content as above note.

- [ ] Add prices more prominently in UI.

- [ ] Improve protection against duplicate orders. (Probably being double
  submitted.) This is a whole can of worms. Consider a script that runs
  periodically instead of fighting it at the source.

- [ ] Only show last 10 of approved list, or paginate.

- [ ] Be specific about activation links being single use.

### Questions

- [ ] ? Have we decided to offer reduced price lunches? What is the price?

### Later

- [ ] Rewrite to be more front-end oriented. Form submit buttons go away.

- [ ] Change menu items so that they are associated not with a day of the week,
  but a specific date. This will make scheduling th menu items a little more
  work, but with a good UI even this can be simple.

- [ ] Ability to merge accounts. This sounds more like an administrative task
  than a feature. Perhaps a script.

- [ ] A la carte integration.

- [ ] Powerschool integration. (I'll only spend time doing this if I have a plan
  to commercialize the product.)
